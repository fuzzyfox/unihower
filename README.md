A tool for the prioritisation of tasks based on Eisenhower Desicion Matricies.

Created as a part of the [CO600 Module](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modulecatalogue/modules/CO600)
submission by [William Duyck](http://wduyck.me) and [Eliot Brown](http://eliotbrown.co.uk), at the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/).

## Abstract
Eisenhower decision matrices split tasks by urgency and importance. This is a
modified version of the original boxes and uses directed graphs.

## Development

### Getting Started
Make sure you have both **grunt** and **bower** installed.

	npm install -g grunt-cli bower

Once installed clone this repository and run:

	npm install && grunt

This will install all the required dependencies, and start the development server
which should now be running on port `4321`.

### Documentation
Looking for some documentation? There are pleanty of code comments throughout the
source, however you can also generate something a little easier to digest if you
have [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org) installed by running:

	jsdoc -c .jsdocrc

This will generate the regular API documentation (in `/docs`) that explains the
methods and modules of the project.

#### REST API Documentation

	// coming soon

### Play nice
Where possible use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) compatible editor/plugin.

* Remove trailing whitespace from files.
* Use ASCII filenames.
* Run `grunt test` before commit and check for errors.

**Do this all with ease!**

	mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
	echo "\n# run grunt build before commit, abort if errors\ngrunt test" >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
